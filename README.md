Problem Understanding
Anime is a “uniquely stylized form of two- and three-dimensional illustration and animation” [1] created in Japan. Until recently, it was “underground” content with only a few supporters outside of Japan. It entered the international scene in 1997 when cartoon network introduced Toonami, a block of time designated to showing anime. It aired shows like “Gundam Wing”, “Tenchi “Muyo!”and “The Big O”. However, in the past 5 years, anime has grown. It is achieving international/ mainstream success with major streaming companies and studios developing their catalogue of anime and anime-based content. It is evidenced by Netflix hiring a chief anime producer in 2017 and Sony buying Crunchyroll* in 2020. 
Despite the success of anime and related anime content, the economy took a major hit due the COVID- 19 pandemic causing companies to hold on production and release of new anime content. Thereby, costing the companies millions of dollars. Companies such as Sony and Netflix lease and buy content from anime creators as well as create original anime content. The objective of this system is to assist companies in producing popular anime and anime related content. Thereby, guiding the companies on deciding what anime content to produce which will reduce the cost to the company as well as increase the supply of in demand anime. 
Usually, anime is released in seasons similar to regular seasons; winter (January-March), spring (April-June), summer (July- September), fall (October- December) seasons. Within the seasons, new anime or a new season of an anime is released and completed. The algorithm should use the data from illegal and legal anime sites at the end of each season to retrain on the new data making the predictions more accurate after each season. 
The assumption is that the before producing an original anime content the companies have a synopsis, potential genre/genres, and the potential number of episodes. Using this information, the hypothesis is that the popularity of an anime can be determined.
To do this, the study aims to answer these questions: 
1.	What is the impact of popularity on the score and rank of anime?
2.	The relationship of anime popularity and the correlation with the episodes, synopsis, genre.
